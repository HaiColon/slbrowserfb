Smalltalk Labs Browser for blogs
================================

What is it?
-----------
Smalltalk Labs Browser for blogs is a JavaScript widget that you can put on	your
blog (or any other kind of website) to allow your blog's readers to display any
Smalltalk class you mention in a blog post in a web based code browser, so that
they don't need to have a Smalltalk image handy when you mention a class in an
article or tutorial.

Visit [http://slbrowserfb.appspot.com](http://slbrowserfb.appspot.com) for more
info and installation instructions.

How to work on the code?
------------------------
I will provide instructions on how to setup a local development environment
soon.

If you want to make changes to the client for use only on your website/blog,
please wait for the public API which is coming soon. This JavaScript API will
allow you to modify the client without having to deploy a forked client and
server on your website.
