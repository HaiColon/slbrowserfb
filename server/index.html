			<div class="hbox" style="margin-top: 0px;"><h2 style="padding-top: 0px;">What is this?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox"><p><b>Smalltalk Labs Browser for blogs</b> is a JavaScript widget
			that you can put on	your blog (or any other kind of website) to allow
			your blog's readers to
			display any Smalltalk class you mention in a blog post in a web based code browser,
			so that they don't need to have a Smalltalk image handy when you mention
			a class in an article or tutorial.</p>
			
			<p><strong>You can try it out by clicking on this Pharo Smalltalk class here</strong>:
			<a href="http://slbrowserfb.appspot.com/code/pharo/1.1/ByteString">ByteString</a></p>
			
			<p>(If you don't use a Mozilla or WebKit browser, you will see a website
			instead of the code browser)</p>
			
			<p>You don't need to have a blog that
			runs on Smalltalk for this, <b>Smalltalk Labs Browser for
			blogs</b> works as a JavaScript widget on your blog and fetches all
			the information about a Smalltalk class
			from a database over the net through AJAX, which means it works on most free blog hosts like
			<a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and
			<a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, the only requirement
			is that you can add custom JavaScript to your blog's theme or your
			website's HTML code.</p></div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>What classes are in this database?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox"><p>At the moment there are all classes of <b>Pharo 1.1</b> in the database.</p>
			
			<p>Popular open source Smalltalk libraries and frameworks will be added soon, e.g. Seaside and Pier.</p>
			
			<p>Squeak is coming up next, then other Smalltalks (where the license
			allows code redistribution).</p>
			
			<p>When a new version of a Smalltalk implementation is uploaded, for example
			Pharo 1.2, the old version is kept so that your old blog posts, articles or
			tutorials still work and point to the right version of a class which might
			have changed or was even removed in a newer release. This isn't a guarantee though,
			I might still be forced to remove a version of a Smalltalk implementation or
			specific classes in a version. This shouldn't happen but you never know.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>What about classes that are not in the database?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox"><p>You will soon be able to upload your own classes, or classes that you
			are allowed to redistribute, into the database yourself. These
			classes will only show up in <b>your</b> version of <b>Smalltalk Labs
			Browser for blogs</b>, not in anyone else's. It will work a bit like a code snippet / pastie service.</p></div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>Sounds cool. How much does it cost?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox">Nothing! This is an open source project that will hopefully benefit the
			whole Smalltalk community and anyone interested in learning Smalltalk. The Smalltalk Labs text in the title of the
			code browser links to my <a href="http://smalltalklabs.tumblr.com">Smalltalk Labs</a> blog (where you can find free Smalltalk and Newspeak related
			tutorials and screencasts). You can easily disable this if you can't live with that, the interactive
			install docs will ask you if you want to do so.</p>
			<p>
			You can get the code at <a href="http://www.github.com/haicolon/slbrowserfb">Github</a> under the open source
			"Apache License, Version 2.0", with portions licensed under the MIT license.

			</p></div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>How do updates work?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox">
			<p>
			You receive <b>updates</b> automatically since you don't download the JavaScript widget but
			instead just include it on your website from this server.
			These updates will add new features and fix bugs or security holes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Upgrades</b> are manual. Upgrades happen when there are breaking changes in the (soon
			to come) public API for any reason, or if there
			is anything else that would need you to manually change something on your website. This
			shouldn't happen too often (or at all).
			The old version will be kept available so that you can take your time to upgrade
			to a never version. Upgrading itself is easy, you just change /v1/ to the new version
			number in the URL to the JavaScript file.
			</p>
			
			<p>You can see the currently deployed version of the Client and the Server below. This
			might help in tracking down a bug if you encounter a problem. The version number relates to upgrades and
			the build number to updates. The code repository uses these version numbers in
			<a href="http://gitref.org/branching/#tag">tags</a>,
			so you can easily view a list of all code commits between two or more versions or upgrades
			if you want to see what has been changed in the newest version for example.</p>
			
			<b>Version 1, build 1</b> - deployed November 11th, 2010</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>I want to give feedback!</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox"><p>That's awesome! You can reach me by email (haicolon at gmail dot com) or
			Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/HaiColon">@HaiColon</a>.</p>
			<p>If you encounter a bug, head on over to the issue tracker on
			<a href="http://www.github.com/haicolon/slbrowserfb/issues">Github</a>.</p></div>
			
			<div class="hbox"><h2>Enough talk! How do I add it to my blog?</h2></div>
			<div class="cbox"><p>Nothing easier than that! Just head over to the
			<a href="/config">configuration</a> interface where you get personalized
			instructions by answering a handful of multiple choice type questions about your blog/website, no signup necessary.</p></div>
